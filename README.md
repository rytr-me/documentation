```bash
curl \

  -X POST https://api.rytr.me/v1/ryte
```

Supply either `toneId` or `voiceId`, not both.

Supported formats `format` = `html` | `text`

Supported creativity levels `creativityLevel` = `default` | `none` | `low` | `medium` | `high` | `max`

Translation `translate` = `ai` | `standard`

You can request upto maximum 3 variants per request, i.e. `variations` = 1 to 3

For `userId` you need to supply user ID from your database, eg: primary key for `users` database table. As a consumer of Rytr API, we assume you have a product/service yourself with user and since they'll be exposed to the Rytr API via your service, we need to track a unique key for each user from your database. It doesn't necessarily need to be a primary key, it can be any unique key generated for each user.
